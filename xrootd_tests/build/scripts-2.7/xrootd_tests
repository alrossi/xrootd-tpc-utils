#  XrootD Third-party Copy Test Package
#  runtests.py
#
#  There are two types of test suites available with this package: the
#  smoke test and the full mesh test.  
#
#  The full mesh test attempts to upload a data file to each endpoint in
#  the mesh, and then to do xrootd third-party copy between the endpoint pairs
#  in both directions, excluding those endpoints where the upload failed.
#  Both source and destination files are removed.
#
#  The smoke test uses one endpoint which is elected as reference (it is 
#  assumed to be valid and working), and tests each other endpoint against
#  it, uploading the file to the endpoint, copying it to the reference,
#  copying it back from the reference to the endpoint, and then downloading
#  it from the endpoint.  Again, source and target files are removed after
#  testing.
#
#  For each of these tests, a summary report is generated and optionally
#  emailed.
#
#  The input and raw output files used to configure and record the results
#  are .json.  If the "capture streams" option is true in the configuration
#  for a test phase, the xrdcp output for each test is written to a separate
#  log file.
