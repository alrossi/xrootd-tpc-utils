        System tests to test viability of xrootd third-party copy between endpoints.
        
        There are two types of test: 
        
            (a) "Full Mesh":   A data file is uploaded to each endpoint, and
                               then transferred both ways between endpoint pairs.
        
            (b) "Smoke":       An endpoint is selected as reference; for all other
                               endpoints, a file is uploaded, transferred to the
                               reference endpoint, transferred back, and then
                               downloaded from the endpoint.
                               
        See also the info in the xrootd_tests script by doing:
        
                python xrootd_tests -i
        
        -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        
        Configuration and Output
        
        The test suite requires a .json configuration file.  Some examples are given
        in the conf directory.
        
        Most of the settings should be self-explanatory.  For the "test-phases",
        "capture-streams" means that the streams from the xrootd executable will be
        redirected to their own log file in the indicated log directory 
        (see under "report").  For the tpc phase, one can try with delegation,
        without delegation, or both.
        
        The full-mesh version of the tests uses the upload phase to place the 
        data file on all endpoints, and the remove phase to delete it from the
        endpoints.
        
        The output from each test suite run is in the form of another .json file
        which records the (extended) configuration instance, plus the metadata for
        each task in the suite, including all out or err lines which appear to 
        indicate errors.   
        
        The summary file is a plain text condensation of the results with some
        basic statistical information (percentage of successes in the case of 
        the full mesh, number of successful hops in the smoke test), followed
        by a listing of the individual failures for each endpoint with the
        last error reported for each.  See the examples directory for
        example output.  The example.log file shows typical output from 
        the script with the -d (debug) option.
        
        The summary file can be emailed using the local smtp server if it
        exists; the 'to' takes a list of recipient addresses.
        
        The configuration allows for automated generation of the x509 proxy
        (see under "gsi-settings", provided permissions for the script user
        are correct) and test data (see under "local-data-file")
        using the unix/linux 'dd' command.
        
        Full-mesh output ranks the endpoints by their percentage of successes;
        the smoke test classifies them as sound (all tests passed)
        or problematic.  The score in the smoke test is a running sum 
        from 0 to 20 updated after each test suite run (to the config file),
        and reflects how reliable the endpoint is.  If it passes all tests,
        its score is incremented by 1, up to the maximum.  Failing a test
        decrements it by 1.
        
        -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        
        The python code was written for version 2.7.
        
        A local pip wheel dist is provided for local installation via:
        
                python -m pip install dist/xrootdtests-1.0-py2-none-any.whl
        
        Note that Python.org sites stopped supporting TLS version 1.0 and 1.1, which 
        could cause issues if you try to update pip wheel on your platform.
        
        In this case, a suggested solution is to upgrade pip without using pip:
        
                curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py | python
